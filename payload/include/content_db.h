/*
 * The console's content databases, read (and repaired) through a real
 * SQLite that the payload links statically.
 *
 * Background: no PS5 firmware ships libSceSqlite.sprx under any library
 * path, so every dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "sqlite3_open_v2") in this codebase
 * resolved to NULL on every console. Two handlers carried a full SQL
 * implementation behind that probe and neither had ever executed; the
 * hand-rolled b-tree walker in appdb_scan.h was doing all the work.
 *
 * That was the right fix for reading title ids, and it stays as the
 * fallback here. What it cannot do is (a) reassemble a row whose columns
 * are serialized blobs — which is why play-time queries were declared
 * impossible — or (b) write. Repairing a console that lists a title it
 * refuses to delete means writing.
 *
 * "Sony does not ship SQLite" is a fact about the platform, not about
 * what we can link. See payload/Makefile for the build flags.
 *
 * Everything here is bounded and emits JSON into a caller-owned buffer.
